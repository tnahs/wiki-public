# Sourdough Starter

## Making a New Starter

### Ingredients

- [ ] 50g rye or whole wheat flour
- [ ] 50g water at room temperature
- [ ] 2 containers

### Directions

1. Thoroughly combine flour and water inside first container.
2. Let rest for 24 hours.
3. In a fresh container, thoroughly combine 50g of the previous day's starter with 50g of water and 50g of flour.
4. Let rest for 24 hours.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the starter doubles in size within 5 hours.

<!-- 70-80F is the ideal temperature range. Below that the yeast incubates very slowly; above it, the starter will tend to ferment alcoholically. -->
