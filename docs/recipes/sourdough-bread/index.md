# Sourdough Bread

## Ingredients

### Dough

- [x] 800g white flour
- [x] 200g whole wheat flour
- [x] 150g levain
- [x] 600g water at 75°F
- [x] 50g water at 90°F
- [x] 25g salt

!!! info

    The flour should be around 13% protein content for this hydration level. Common all-purpose/bread flours contains 4g of protein per 30g of flour which equates to about 13% protein.

    "Bakers math" tells us that 1000g of total flour and 650g of water equates to a dough with 65% hydration.

    <!-- TODO:LOW Note about protein content and hydration levels. -->

## Directions

### Preparations

Before preparing the dough, a levain needs to be generated from the sourdough starter. See [Making a Levain](./../sourdough-starter/index.md#making-a-levain). This needs to be done at least 8 hours in advance, the exact time depending on the ambient room temperature.[^variables]

The levain can be prepared in the evening and allowed to rise overnight. If timed properly dough-making can start first thing in the morning.

!!! note

    This recipe will assume the ambient temperature is around 75°F. A simple way to create this environment is by turning the light on inside a cold oven.

[^variables]: This is not exactly true, there are other other variables, some of which are fixed in this recipe.

### Mixing the Dough

Combine **800g of white flour**, **200g of whole wheat flour** and **600g of water at 75°F**. Mix thoroughly until you have a fully homogenous ball of dough. Place in a sealed container and let it rest in a 75°F environment for 30-45 minutes. This is period is called the _Autolyse_[^autolyse].

Dissolve **25g of salt** with **50g of water at 90°F**. After the autolyse, incorporate into dough and until homogenous. Unload the dough onto a work surface and knead and stretch the dough for a few minutes until it beings to stiffen. Roll into a tight ball, place it back into a sealed container and let it rest in a 75°F environment.

!!! tip

    To keep the dough from forming a skin lightly mist the top with some water every time the dough is handled.

[^autolyse]:
    _The term was coined by French baking professor Raymond Calvel, who recommended the procedure as a means of reducing kneading time, thereby improving the flavor and color of bread. Long kneading times subject bread dough to atmospheric oxygen, which bleaches the naturally occurring carotenoids in bread flour, robbing the flour of its natural creamy color and flavor. An autolyse also makes the dough easier to shape and improves structure._

    [Autolysis\_\(biology\) - Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autolysis_(biology)#Use>)

### First Proofing

Set a timer for **3h:30m** and one for **1h:00m**. After one hour has passed, perform a [Coil Fold](#coil-fold), lightly mist with water, cover and store back into the oven. Set another timer for **1h:00m** and repeat. Let the dough rest for the final **1h:30m**.

### Pre-Shaping

Once the dough has proofed for the full 3h:30m, it's time to pre-shape it. This is where we will really handle the dough.

!!! note

    Instead of using flour to keep things from sticking, we'll be using water. This helps keep the sticky to itself but not to other things.

Place a large flat container on top of your digital scale and mist it with some water. We'll be using this to split our dough into two equal parts. Following the [dough ingredient weights](#dough) at the start of this recipe half the dough should be 912.5g. But, no need to be exact, close is good enough.

Before taking the dough out, mist your work surface, preferably something non-porous like a quartz or granite counter-top or a marble pastry work surface.[^marble]

!!! warning

    From here on out we want to preserve the top of the dough. This surface has stretched and relaxed over the past three hours and now has a really nice gluten structure. All proceeding actions should be done with this in mind. 

Flip the dough onto your misted work surface (top side up), using a [dough scraper](#optional-ingredients-tools) split the dough in half using the scale to ensure an even split. Any extra slivers of dough used to balance out the halves should be placed under our dough (remember, the top is preserved).

Using a tucking motion, roll the dough into two semi-tight balls, mist with water, cover and let rest for 15 minutes.

[^marble]:
    If we're trying to maintain a specific dough temperature, working on a thermally conductive work surface isn't generally a good idea. But at this point the first proofing is complete and shortly after the dough will be refrigerated.

### Shaping

Prep and place in [bannetons](#optional-ingredients-tools).

### Second Proofing

Proof overnight 12-16 hours.

### Baking the Dough

1. Place the [dutch oven](#optional-ingrredients-tools) into the oven.
2. Preheat the oven to 500°F.
3. Once the oven reaches temperature set a timer for 45 minutes.

It's important that the dutch oven get as close as possible to 500°F[^500F]. An oven at temperature doesn't necessarily mean its contents are at that temperature. Moreover, cast iron takes time to heat up (But retains it well!). Therefore, another 45 or so minutes will allow the dutch oven's temperature to climb. Alternatively a temperature gun can be used to check the dutch oven's temperature.

1. The next step.
2. The step after.

[^500F]: The closest I've managed has been around 490°F.

### Proofing Time Table

This table[^proofing-time-table] should be used as a rough guide. With just the oven light my oven can fluctuate between 75-80°F depending on the time of year so I aim for 3:00-3:30 for the first proofing.

!!! note

    These numbers are based on a 75% (750g water) hydration dough with a 2% (20g) salt content. However, this recipe is for a 65% hydration dough with a 2.5% salt content.
