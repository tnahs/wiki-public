# Sourdough Bread

## Ingredients

### Dough

- [ ] 800g All-purpose or bread flour
- [ ] 200g Whole wheat flour
- [ ] 200g Levain
- [ ] 650g Water at room temperature
- [ ] 20g Salt

!!! info

    The flour should be around 13% protein content for this hydration level. Common all-purpose/bread flours contains 4g of protein per 30g of flour which equates to about 13% protein.

    "Bakers math" tells us that 1000g of total flour and 650g of water equates to a dough with 65% hydration.

    <!-- TODO:LOW Note about protein content and hydration levels. -->

### Proofing/Baking/Tools

#### Recommended

- [ ] [Lodge Combo Cooker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009JKG9M)

#### Optional

- [ ] 1/4 cup Tablespoon rice flour
- [ ] 1 Tablespoon semolina
- [ ] [Feather Double Edge Blades](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AGG3MRG)
- [ ] 2 [10" Oval Bannetons](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUG8QFJ)

## Directions

### Preparations

Before preparing the dough, a levain needs to be generated from the sourdough starter. See [Making a Levain](./../sourdough-starter/index.md#making-a-levain). This needs to be done about 8 hours in advance, the exact time depending on the ambient room temperature.[^1]

The levain can be prepared in the evening and allowed to rise overnight. If timed properly dough-making can start first thing in the morning.

!!! note

    This recipe will assume the ambient temperature is around 75°F. A simple way to create this environment is by 'converting' a conventional oven to a proofing oven. See [Making a Proofer](#making-a-proofer).   

[^1]: This is not exactly true, there are other other variables, some of which are set in this recipe.

### Preparing the Dough

1. Mix the **flour** and **water** and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. This is period is called the *Autolyse*[^autolyse].
2. Add the **levain** and **salt** into dough and incorporate until homogenous. Once everything is incorporated, start a timer and let the dough rest for 15 minutes[^timer].
3. Split the dough into two equal portions.[^pre-shaping] Stretch and fold each portion until stiff. Then roll into a [Boule](#boule).
4. For the next three hours perform a [Coil Fold](#coil-fold) per hour.
5. Let rest for another hour.
6. Shaping.
7. Prep and place in [bannetons](#tools).
8. Proof overnight 12-16 hours.

[^autolyse]:
    *The term was coined by French baking professor Raymond Calvel, who recommended the procedure as a means of reducing kneading time, thereby improving the flavor and color of bread. Long kneading times subject bread dough to atmospheric oxygen, which bleaches the naturally occurring carotenoids in bread flour, robbing the flour of its natural creamy color and flavor. An autolyse also makes the dough easier to shape and improves structure.*

    [Autolysis_\(biology\) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autolysis_(biology)#Use)

[^timer]: The first proofing has begun at this point and it's necessary to keep track of the elapsed time to compare to the table under [Proofing Times](#proofing-times).

[^pre-shaping]: This step is typically done after the first proofing however if done improperly this can cause the dough to deflate. A simple workaround is to split the dough before the first proofing.

### Baking the Dough

1. Place the [dutch oven](#tools) into the oven.
2. Preheat the oven to 500°F.
3. Once the oven reaches temperature set a timer for 45 minutes.

It's important that the dutch oven get as close as possible to 500°F[^2]. An oven at temperature doesn't necessarily mean its contents are at that temperature. Moreover, cast iron takes time to heat up (But retains it well!). Therefore, another 45 or so minutes will allow the dutch oven's temperature to climb. Alternatively a temperature gun can be used to check the dutch oven's temperature.

1. The next step.
2. The step after.

[^2]: The closest I've managed has been around 450°F.
