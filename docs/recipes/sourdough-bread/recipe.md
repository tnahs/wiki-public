# Sourdough Bread (65% hydration)

## Ingredients

### Dough

- [ ] 800g All-purpose or bread flour
- [ ] 200g Whole wheat
- [ ] 200g Levain
- [ ] 325g Water
- [ ] 20g Salt

!!! note

    Flour should be around 13% protein content for this hydration level. Common all-purpose/bread flour contains 4g of protein per 30g of flour which is about 13% protein.

### Proofing/Baking

- [ ] 1 Tablespoon Rice flour (Optional)
- [ ] 1 Tablespoon Semolina or corn flour (Optional)
- [ ] Razor blade (Optional)
- [ ] 2 Bannetons (Optional)
- [ ] Dutch oven

## Directions

### Preparations

Before preparing the dough, a levain needs to be generated from the sourdough starter. See [Making a Levain](./../sourdough-starter/recipe.md#making-a-levain). This needs to be done about 8 hours in advance, the exact time depending on the ambient room temperature.[^1]

The levain can be prepared in the evening and allowed to rise overnight. If timed properly dough-making can start first thing in the morning.

This recipe will assume the ambient temperature is around 75°F / 24°C. A simple way to create this environment is by 'converting' a conventional oven to a proofing oven. See [Making a Proofer](#making-a-proofer).

[^1]: This is not exactly true, there are other other variables, some of which are set in this recipe.

### Preparing the Dough

1. Mix **flour** and **water** and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.
2. Add **salt** and **levain** into dough and incorporate until homogenous.

Once the levain is added to the dough, the fermentation begins. Start a timer.

3. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes.
4. Split the dough into two equal portions. Stretch and fold each portion until stiff. Then roll into a [Boule](#boule).
5. For the next three hours perform a [Coil Fold](#coil-fold) per hour.
6. Let rest for another hour.
7. Shaping.
8. Prep and place in [bannetons](#tools).
9. Proof overnight 12-16 hours.

### Baking the Dough

1. Place the [dutch oven](#tools) into the oven.
2. Preheat the oven to 500°F / 260°C.
3. Once the oven reaches temperature set a timer for 45 minutes.

It's important that the dutch oven get as close as possible to 500°F / 260°C[^2]. An oven at temperature doesn't necessarily mean its contents are at that temperature. Moreover, cast iron takes time to heat up (But retains it well!). Therefore, another 45 or so minutes will allow the dutch oven's temperature to climb. Alternatively a temperature gun can be used to check the dutch oven's temperature.

1. The next step.
2. The step after.

[^2]: The closest I've managed has been around 450°F / 232°C.
