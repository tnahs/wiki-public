!!! quote

    After your Synology NAS has been reset, the data on the Synology NAS will remain intact. However, before you reset your Synology NAS and re-install DSM, we highly recommended you to launch the [...] the Hyper Backup package [...] on your DSM, so as to back up your data and system configuration settings in case unexpected data loss occurs.
