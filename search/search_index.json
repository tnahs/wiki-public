Optional Ingredients & Tools \u00b6 dutch oven dough scraper rice flour semolina digital scale 2 gallon sealable bags (2) spray bottle with water ambient temperature gauge blades bannetons (2) Recommendations \u00b6 Lodge Combo Cooker Feather Double Edge Blades 10\u201d Oval Bannetons Directions \u00b6 Preparations \u00b6 Before preparing the dough, a levain needs to be generated from the sourdough starter. See Making a Levain . This needs to be done at least 8 hours in advance, the exact time depending on the ambient room temperature. 1 The levain can be prepared in the evening and allowed to rise overnight. If timed properly dough-making can start first thing in the morning. Note This recipe will assume the ambient temperature is around 75\u00b0F. A simple way to create this environment is by turning the light on inside a cold oven. Mixing the Dough \u00b6 Combine 800g of white flour , 200g of whole wheat flour and 600g of water at 75\u00b0F . Mix thoroughly until you have a fully homogenous ball of dough. Place in a sealed container and let it rest in a 75\u00b0F environment for 30-45 minutes. This is period is called the Autolyse 2 . Dissolve 25g of salt with 50g of water at 90\u00b0F . After the autolyse, incorporate into dough and until homogenous. Unload the dough onto a work surface and knead and stretch the dough for a few minutes until it beings to stiffen. Roll into a tight ball, place it back into a sealed container and let it rest in a 75\u00b0F environment. Tip To keep the dough from forming a skin lightly mist the top with some water every time the dough is handled. First Proofing \u00b6 Set a timer for 3h:30m and one for 1h:00m . After one hour has passed, perform a Coil Fold , lightly mist with water, cover and store back into the oven. Set another timer for 1h:00m and repeat. Let the dough rest for the final 1h:30m . Pre-Shaping \u00b6 Once the dough has proofed for the full 3h:30m, it\u2019s time to pre-shape it. This is where we will really handle the dough. Note Instead of using flour to keep things from sticking, we\u2019ll be using water. This helps keep the sticky to itself but not to other things. Place a large flat container on top of your digital scale and mist it with some water. We\u2019ll be using this to split our dough into two equal parts. Following the dough ingredient weights at the start of this recipe half the dough should be 912.5g. But, no need to be exact, close is good enough. Before taking the dough out, mist your work surface, preferably something non-porous like a quartz or granite counter-top or a marble pastry work surface. 3 Warning From here on out we want to preserve the top of the dough. This surface has stretched and relaxed over the past three hours and now has a really nice gluten structure. All proceeding actions should be done with this in mind. Flip the dough onto your misted work surface (top side up), using a dough scraper split the dough in half using the scale to ensure an even split. Any extra slivers of dough used to balance out the halves should be placed under our dough (remember, the top is preserved). Using a tucking motion, roll the dough into two semi-tight balls, mist with water, cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Shaping \u00b6 Prep and place in bannetons . Second Proofing \u00b6 Proof overnight 12-16 hours. Baking the Dough \u00b6 Place the dutch oven into the oven. Preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F. Once the oven reaches temperature set a timer for 45 minutes. It\u2019s important that the dutch oven get as close as possible to 500\u00b0F 4 . An oven at temperature doesn\u2019t necessarily mean its contents are at that temperature. Moreover, cast iron takes time to heat up (But retains it well!). Therefore, another 45 or so minutes will allow the dutch oven\u2019s temperature to climb. Alternatively a temperature gun can be used to check the dutch oven\u2019s temperature. The next step. The step after. Reference \u00b6 Proofing Time Table \u00b6 This table 5 should be used as a rough guide. With just the oven light my oven can fluctuate between 75-80\u00b0F depending on the time of year so I aim for 3:00-3:30 for the first proofing. Note These numbers are based on a 75% (750g water) hydration dough with a 2% (20g) salt content. However, this recipe is for a 65% hydration dough with a 2.5% salt content.

IP is the primary way in which network connections are made, and it establishes the basis of the Internet. IP does not handle packet ordering or error checking. Such functionality requires another protocol, typically TCP. The TCP/IP relationship is similar to sending someone a message written on a puzzle through the mail. The message is written down and the puzzle is broken into pieces. Each piece then can travel through a different postal route, some of which take longer than others. When the puzzle pieces arrive after traversing their different paths, the pieces may be out of order. The Internet Protocol makes sure the pieces arrive at their destination address. The TCP protocol can be thought of as the puzzle assembler on the other side who puts the pieces together in the right order, asks for missing pieces to be resent, and lets the sender know the puzzle has been received. TCP maintains the connection with the sender from before the first puzzle piece is sent to after the final piece is sent. IP is a connectionless protocol, which means that each unit of data is individually addressed and routed from the source device to the target device, and the target does not send an acknowledgement back to the source. That\u2019s where protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) come in.
