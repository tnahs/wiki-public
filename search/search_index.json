See Making a Levain . This needs to be done about 8 hours in advance, the exact time depending on the ambient room temperature. 1 The levain can be prepared in the evening and allowed to rise overnight. If timed properly dough-making can start first thing in the morning. Note This recipe will assume the ambient temperature is around 75\u00b0F. A simple way to create this environment is by \u2018converting\u2019 a conventional oven to a proofing oven. See Making a Proofer . Preparing the Dough \u00b6 Mix the flour and water and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. This is period is called the Autolyse 2 . Add the levain and salt into dough and incorporate until homogenous. Once everything is incorporated, start a timer and let the dough rest for 15 minutes 3 . Split the dough into two equal portions. 4 Stretch and fold each portion until stiff. Then roll into a Boule . For the next three hours perform a Coil Fold per hour. Let rest for another hour. Shaping. Prep and place in bannetons . Proof overnight 12-16 hours. Baking the Dough \u00b6 Place the dutch oven into the oven. Preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F. Once the oven reaches temperature set a timer for 45 minutes. It\u2019s important that the dutch oven get as close as possible to 500\u00b0F 5 . An oven at temperature doesn\u2019t necessarily mean its contents are at that temperature. Moreover, cast iron takes time to heat up (But retains it well!). Therefore, another 45 or so minutes will allow the dutch oven\u2019s temperature to climb. Alternatively a temperature gun can be used to check the dutch oven\u2019s temperature. The next step.

Long kneading times subject bread dough to atmospheric oxygen, which bleaches the naturally occurring carotenoids in bread flour, robbing the flour of its natural creamy color and flavor. An autolyse also makes the dough easier to shape and improves structure. Autolysis_(biology) - Wikipedia \u21a9 The first proofing has begun at this point and it\u2019s necessary to keep track of the elapsed time to compare to the table under Proofing Times . \u21a9 This step is typically done after the first proofing however if done improperly this can cause the dough to deflate. A simple workaround is to split the dough before the first proofing. \u21a9 The closest I\u2019ve managed has been around 450\u00b0F. \u21a9","title":"Sourdough Bread"},{"location":"recipes/sourdough-bread/#sourdough-bread","text":"","title":"Sourdough Bread"},{"location":"recipes/sourdough-bread/#ingredients","text":"","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"recipes/sourdough-bread/#dough","text":"800g All-purpose or bread flour 200g Whole wheat flour 200g Levain 650g Water at room temperature 20g Salt Info The flour should be around 13% protein content for this hydration level.

Long kneading times subject bread dough to atmospheric oxygen, which bleaches the naturally occurring carotenoids in bread flour, robbing the flour of its natural creamy color and flavor. An autolyse also makes the dough easier to shape and improves structure. Autolysis_(biology) - Wikipedia \u21a9 The first proofing has begun at this point and it\u2019s necessary to keep track of the elapsed time to compare to the table under Proofing Times . \u21a9 This step is typically done after the first proofing however if done improperly this can cause the dough to deflate.

IP is the primary way in which network connections are made, and it establishes the basis of the Internet. IP does not handle packet ordering or error checking. Such functionality requires another protocol, typically TCP. The TCP/IP relationship is similar to sending someone a message written on a puzzle through the mail. The message is written down and the puzzle is broken into pieces. Each piece then can travel through a different postal route, some of which take longer than others. When the puzzle pieces arrive after traversing their different paths, the pieces may be out of order. The Internet Protocol makes sure the pieces arrive at their destination address. The TCP protocol can be thought of as the puzzle assembler on the other side who puts the pieces together in the right order, asks for missing pieces to be resent, and lets the sender know the puzzle has been received. TCP maintains the connection with the sender from before the first puzzle piece is sent to after the final piece is sent. IP is a connectionless protocol, which means that each unit of data is individually addressed and routed from the source device to the target device, and the target does not send an acknowledgement back to the source. That\u2019s where protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) come in. TCP is used in conjunction with IP in order to maintain a connection between the sender and the target and to ensure packet order. What is TCP/IP? - Cloudflare UDP \u00b6 Quote The User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups. It speeds up communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is transferred. This allows data to be transferred very quickly, but it can also cause packets to become lost in transit \u2014 and create opportunities for exploitation in the form of DDoS attacks. What is UDP? - Cloudflare Common Network Ports & Protocols \u00b6 Quote The port numbers in the range from 0 to 1023 (0 to 2 10 \u2212 1) are the well-known ports or system ports. They are used by system processes that provide widely used types of network services. On Unix-like operating systems, a process must execute with superuser privileges to be able to bind a network socket to an IP address using one of the well-known ports. [\u2026] The range of port numbers from 1024 to 49151 (2 10 to 2 14 + 2 15 \u2212 1) are the registered ports. They are assigned by IANA for specific service upon application by a requesting entity. On most systems, registered ports can be used without superuser privileges.
