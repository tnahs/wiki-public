Cook on medium heat for 20 minutes, turning occasionally with metal tongs until the outside is totally burnt and the aubergine starts to collapse on itself. Alternatively, place the pierced aubergines on a tin foil lined tray under a hot grill in the oven for an hour, turning every 20 minutes. Remove from and place in a colander. Cut a single slit in each aubergine, from top to bottom and allow the juices to strain. Once cool enough to handle, scoop out all the flesh, avoiding all black skin, and set aside.

It needs to be thick and rich, but you may need to add a splash of water if it is stiff. Next heat up the olive oil in a medium, heavy-based frying pan.

The leeks and spinach can be made up to a day ahead and kept in the fridge, ready for the eggs to be cracked in and braised. Put the butter and 1 tablespoon of oil into a large saut\u00e9 pan, for which you have a lid, and place on a medium high heat. Once the butter starts to foam, add the leeks, \u00bd teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Fry for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the leeks are soft. Add the cumin, lemon and vegetable stock and boil rapidly for 4\u20135 minutes, until most of the stock has evaporated. Fold in the spinach and cook for a minute, until wilted, then reduce the heat to medium. Use a large spoon to make 6 indentations in the mixture and break one egg into each space. Sprinkle the eggs with a pinch of salt, dot the feta around the eggs, then cover the pan. Simmer for 4\u20135 minutes, until the egg whites are cooked but the yolks are still runny. Mix the za\u2019atar with the remaining tablespoon of oil and brush over the eggs. Serve at once, straight from the pan.","title":"Braised eggs with leek and za\u2019atar aka Green Shakshuka"},{"location":"recipes/empanadas-con-queso/","text":"Empanadas con Queso \u00b6","title":"Empanadas con Queso"},{"location":"recipes/empanadas-con-queso/#empanadas-con-queso","text":"","title":"Empanadas con Queso"},{"location":"recipes/sourdough-bread/","text":"Sourdough Bread \u00b6 Ingredients \u00b6 Dough \u00b6 800g All-purpose or bread flour 200g Whole wheat flour 200g Levain 650g Water at room temperature 20g Salt Info The flour should be around 13% protein content for this hydration level.

IP is the primary way in which network connections are made, and it establishes the basis of the Internet. IP does not handle packet ordering or error checking. Such functionality requires another protocol, typically TCP. The TCP/IP relationship is similar to sending someone a message written on a puzzle through the mail. The message is written down and the puzzle is broken into pieces. Each piece then can travel through a different postal route, some of which take longer than others. When the puzzle pieces arrive after traversing their different paths, the pieces may be out of order. The Internet Protocol makes sure the pieces arrive at their destination address. The TCP protocol can be thought of as the puzzle assembler on the other side who puts the pieces together in the right order, asks for missing pieces to be resent, and lets the sender know the puzzle has been received. TCP maintains the connection with the sender from before the first puzzle piece is sent to after the final piece is sent. IP is a connectionless protocol, which means that each unit of data is individually addressed and routed from the source device to the target device, and the target does not send an acknowledgement back to the source. That\u2019s where protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) come in. TCP is used in conjunction with IP in order to maintain a connection between the sender and the target and to ensure packet order. What is TCP/IP? - Cloudflare UDP \u00b6 Quote The User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups. It speeds up communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is transferred. This allows data to be transferred very quickly, but it can also cause packets to become lost in transit \u2014 and create opportunities for exploitation in the form of DDoS attacks. What is UDP? - Cloudflare Common Network Ports & Protocols \u00b6 Quote The port numbers in the range from 0 to 1023 (0 to 2 10 \u2212 1) are the well-known ports or system ports. They are used by system processes that provide widely used types of network services. On Unix-like operating systems, a process must execute with superuser privileges to be able to bind a network socket to an IP address using one of the well-known ports. [\u2026] The range of port numbers from 1024 to 49151 (2 10 to 2 14 + 2 15 \u2212 1) are the registered ports. They are assigned by IANA for specific service upon application by a requesting entity.
