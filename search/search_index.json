IP is the primary way in which network connections are made, and it establishes the basis of the Internet. IP does not handle packet ordering or error checking. Such functionality requires another protocol, typically TCP. The TCP/IP relationship is similar to sending someone a message written on a puzzle through the mail. The message is written down and the puzzle is broken into pieces. Each piece then can travel through a different postal route, some of which take longer than others. When the puzzle pieces arrive after traversing their different paths, the pieces may be out of order. The Internet Protocol makes sure the pieces arrive at their destination address. The TCP protocol can be thought of as the puzzle assembler on the other side who puts the pieces together in the right order, asks for missing pieces to be resent, and lets the sender know the puzzle has been received. TCP maintains the connection with the sender from before the first puzzle piece is sent to after the final piece is sent. IP is a connectionless protocol, which means that each unit of data is individually addressed and routed from the source device to the target device, and the target does not send an acknowledgement back to the source. That\u2019s where protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) come in.

Common all-purpose/bread flour contains 4g of protein per 30g of flour which is about 13% protein. Proofing/Baking \u00b6 1 Tablespoon Rice flour (Optional) 1 Tablespoon Semolina or corn flour (Optional) Razor blade (Optional) 2 Bannetons (Optional) Dutch oven Directions \u00b6 Preparations \u00b6 Before preparing the dough, a levain needs to be generated from the sourdough starter. See Making a Levain . This needs to be done about 8 hours in advance, the exact time depending on the ambient room temperature. 1 The levain can be prepared in the evening and allowed to rise overnight. If timed properly dough-making can start first thing in the morning. This recipe will assume the ambient temperature is around 75\u00b0F / 24\u00b0C. A simple way to create this environment is by \u2018converting\u2019 a conventional oven to a proofing oven. See Making a Proofer . Preparing the Dough \u00b6 Mix flour and water and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. Add salt and levain into dough and incorporate until homogenous. Once the levain is added to the dough, the fermentation begins. Start a timer. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes. Split the dough into two equal portions. Stretch and fold each portion until stiff. Then roll into a Boule . For the next three hours perform a Coil Fold per hour. Let rest for another hour. Shaping. Prep and place in bannetons . Proof overnight 12-16 hours. Baking the Dough \u00b6 Place the dutch oven into the oven. Preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F / 260\u00b0C. Once the oven reaches temperature set a timer for 45 minutes. It\u2019s important that the dutch oven get as close as possible to 500\u00b0F / 260\u00b0C 2 . An oven at temperature doesn\u2019t necessarily mean its contents are at that temperature. Moreover, cast iron takes time to heat up (But retains it well!). Therefore, another 45 or so minutes will allow the dutch oven\u2019s temperature to climb. Alternatively a temperature gun can be used to check the dutch oven\u2019s temperature. The next step. The step after.

See Making a Levain . This needs to be done about 8 hours in advance, the exact time depending on the ambient room temperature. 1 The levain can be prepared in the evening and allowed to rise overnight. If timed properly dough-making can start first thing in the morning. This recipe will assume the ambient temperature is around 75\u00b0F / 24\u00b0C. A simple way to create this environment is by \u2018converting\u2019 a conventional oven to a proofing oven.

Add salt and levain into dough and incorporate until homogenous. Once the levain is added to the dough, the fermentation begins. Start a timer. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes. Split the dough into two equal portions. Stretch and fold each portion until stiff. Then roll into a Boule . For the next three hours perform a Coil Fold per hour. Let rest for another hour. Shaping.

Moreover, cast iron takes time to heat up (But retains it well!). Therefore, another 45 or so minutes will allow the dutch oven\u2019s temperature to climb.
